### Initial Reaction
- Initially it looks like an interesting proposition. Though, we definitely need to be skeptical because this may not be the most valid claim.
- Though the article presents that there may be an edge for home teams, I am interested in the extent of the edge. Is 54% that significant or can that be potentially due to variation or chance?
- I am also curious about the time frame. The frame goes back to the 1950s, where values did appear quite high, but now they are significantly lower. Is the argument still valid?
- Another question I have is respect to the Refs. Are the refs always rotating? Or is it always the same refs baased in certain courts.

### Important notes
- Disregarding the impact of potentially other confounding variables. Even though they mention other affects, the article fails to delve deeper into these kinds of statistics.
- When you set the maximum time frame for mistakes by Refs, we see that its relatively balanced, with both teams away and at home benefitting from the incorrect calls. 
- The initial graph demonstrating the home court advantage is interesting, because we see that although there may have been some earlier differences, these values have drastically dropped off as time went on converging toward 2000.
- The timeframe of the database as well includes only the last 2-minutes of the game for games within 5 points. I think that it would be important to consider what happens beyond this time frame.
